      <p>Step 1: Review and understand the concepts of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. This includes their mathematical models, assumptions, and the nature of problem they are used to solve.
  
Step 2: Learn how to implement these models using libraries in Python like Scikit-Learn. Gain practice with these implementations using simple datasets to predict quantitative (for Linear Regression) and categorical outcomes (for Logistic Regression).

Step 3: Practice interpreting the results from both regression models. In case of Linear Regression, understand how to interpret the regression coefficients. In case of Logistic Regression, learn how to interpret the odds ratios.

Step 4: Learn about techniques to evaluate the performance of your model including measures like R-squared, Mean Square Error for Linear Regression, and Accuracy, Precision, Recall for Logistic Regression.

Step 5: Get hands-on experience with more complex datasets by setting up, running, and evaluating models on these datasets. Practice troubleshooting common issues, such as handling overfitting or underfitting.</p>
