      <p>Step 1: Understanding Basic Concepts
The third week of learning will start with understanding the basic concepts of Decision Trees and Random Forests. You will be introduced to topics like what decision trees are, their structure, and how they work in making predictions. You will understand the randomness in Random Forests and how it improves model performance.

Step 2: Learning Algorithms for Decision Trees 
You will learn the main algorithms used to create decision trees: ID3, C4.5, and CART. This step will involve learning the logic behind the algorithms, the way they decide the best attribute for each node, and how they handle continuous and categorical attributes.

Step 3: Deeper Understanding of Random Forest
The learners will delve deeper into Random Forests, understanding how multiple decision trees are trained in this algorithm and how the final decision is made. The concept of bootstrapping and bagging will also be explained at this stage.

Step 4: Practical Exercise and Implementations
